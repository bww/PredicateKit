/*
  Expression grammar tests.
  
  Test evaluated as pairs of expressions delimited by semicolons. The first
  expression is the expression to be evaluated. The second expression should
  be a constant which is the expected result of the first expression.
  
  For example, to test that the expression (1 < 2) is false, we might use:
  1 < 2; true;
